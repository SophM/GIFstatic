# GIFstatic - Around the world

In this project, I built a web page that dynamically creates buttons and displays GIFs corresponding to the user input. The theme is "Around the world" and the user is asked to enter a city or a monument. The idea is to "travel"/discover the world through GIFs. It is fascinating to see what is out there to describe/represent famous cities or monuments!

The GIFs, along with their rating, are obtained by making AJAX requests to the GIPHY API. Some constraints have been applied on the ratings so that this app is family-friendly. The GIFs are static when displayed but the user can click on them to animate them. Once animated, the user can click on them again to make them static and vice-versa.

This app has a responsive layout and can be visited on different devices!
