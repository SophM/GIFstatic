# GIFstatic

In this project, I built a web page that dynamically creates buttons and displays GIFs corresponding to the user input. The user is asked to enter a city or a monument. The theme is then called "Around the world" and the idea is to "travel"/discover the world though GIFs. It is fascinating to see what is out there to describe/represent famous cities or monuments!

The GIFs, along with their rating, are obtained by making AJAX request to the GIPHY API.

This app has a responsive layout and can be visited on different devices!
