### GIFstatic - Around the world

1. On the web page, we can see:
    - several buttons with a label corresponding to the name of a city, country or monument
    - an input form where the user can add a city, country or monument

2. If the user does a "search", his/her search will create a new button, which will be displayed on the page and join the other buttons. The label on the button will correspond to the user input.

3. When the user clicks on a button, 10 GIFs in relation to the label of the button (with their rating) are displayed on the web page.

4. The GIFs are static at first. They become animated when the user clicks on it.

5. When the user clicks on another button, the previous GIFs disappear and the new GIFs appear. The new GIFs aren't appended/prepended to the web page.They REPLACE the previous ones. The HTML element holding the GIFs is emptied each time a new button is clicked and then populated again by the new GIFs.
